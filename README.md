# ContrastiveLearning-Experiments

This repository contains my implementations and experiments related to contrastive learning. It includes replications of important research papers in the field. The repository serves as both a record of my learning process and a platform for further exploration.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

- `1. Unsupervised Feature Learning via Non-parametric Instance Discrimination/`: Replication of the paper focused on unsupervised feature learning.
- `2. Unsupervised Embedding Learning via Invariant and Spreading Instance Feature/`: Code for the replication of a paper on embedding learning.
- `3. Representation Learning with Contrastive Predictive Coding/`: Implementation of contrastive predictive coding techniques.
- `4. Contrastive Multiview Coding/`: Replication of multiview contrastive coding research.

## Getting Started

To get started with the code, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ContrastiveLearning-Experiments.git
